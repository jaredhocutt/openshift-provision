# OpenShift Provisioner

Provision infrastructure and install OpenShift.

The goal of this project is to support installing OpenShift across multiple
clouds and virtualization platforms.

## Getting Started

This project is built using Ansible playbooks, including the use of modules
that require additional packages to be installed in order to function.

To make the use of this project easier, a container has been created that has
all of the required dependencies and is configured to work out of the box.

To use the container, you will need a container runtime. I recommend using
[podman](https://github.com/projectatomic/libpod) or
[docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

Start by cloning this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaredhocutt/openshift-provision.git

cd openshift-provision/
```

## Known Issues

### Issue: GlusterFS broken in latest releases of OpenShift 3.11

When installing OpenShift 3.11, the latest dot releases have a bug that
causes GlusterFS to fail or not install correctly.

The workaround for this is to install the last known good version of
OpenShift 3.11, which is OpenShift 3.11.43.

In your variable file where you have `openshift_version: "3.11"` set,
add an additional option:

```yaml
openshift_version: "3.11"
openshift_version_minor: "3.11.43"
```

### Issue: Docker for Mac does not work

Running this tool using Docker for Mac does not work. During the OpenShift
installation portion, which is a long running process, the Ansible SSH
connection will drop and not recover.

This does not happen when running from a Linux machine. Therefore, the
current workaround is to use a Linux VM (either on your Mac or running
in AWS) and execute this tool from that Linux VM.

This issue will exhibit itself with an error that looks similar to the following:

```bash
TASK [install_openshift : Run OpenShift installer (this will take a while!)] **

## Provisioners

### AWS

#### Deploy

##### Step 1

There are several variables that you will need to define before running the
AWS provisioner.

| Variable                         | Required           | Default                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

For your convenience, there is an example variables file at
`<openshift-provision>/vars/aws.example.yml`. Go ahead and make a copy of this
file and update the variable values. The contents of that file is also shown below.

This guide will assume the file is located at `<openshift-provision>/vars/aws.yml`.

```yaml
# The name of the cluster.
# This value will be in your DNS entries and should conform to valid DNS characters.
cluster_name: openshift

# The OpenShift version to install
# IMPORTANT: Make sure this value is quoted, otherwise it gets read as 3.1 instead of 3.10
openshift_version: "3.11"
# The base subdomain to use for your cluster.
# Example: If you set this to `example.com`, a DNS entry for `<cluster_name>.example.com` will be created)
openshift_base_domain: example.com

# The email address to use when generating Lets Encrypt certs for the cluster.
cert_email_address: foo@example.com

# The AWS region (i.e. `us-east-1`)
aws_region: us-east-1
# If you have Cloud Access setup for your account, set this to `cloud_access`. Otherwise, set this to `hourly`.
ec2_ami_type: cloud_access
# The ID of the Route53 hosted zone
route53_hosted_zone_id: YP563J79RELJ4C

# Your RHSM username
rhsm_username: foo@example.com
# Your RHSM password
rhsm_password: P@55w0rD
# The RHSM pool ID that contains OpenShift subscriptions
rhsm_pool: ba4e7732f8abcdad545c7f62df736d1f

# Your Red Hat registry username
redhat_registry_username: 1234567|foo
# Your Red Hat registry password/token
redhat_registry_password: 0535VZW0qDK3fBjFwJE93emjk8fmzNBLJ2XHN8TNrAsxmaqDOOz2G

# The users to create in OpenShift
openshift_users:
  - username: admin
    password: password
    admin: yes
  - username: user1
    password: password
  - username: user2
    password: password
  - username: user3
    password: password
```

##### Step 2

You will also need to set a few environment variables. For your convenience,
there is an example environment file at `<openshift-provision>/vars/aws.example.env`.
Go ahead and make a copy of this file and update the environment variable values. The
contents of that file is also shown below.

This guide will assume the file is located at `<openshift-provision>/vars/aws.env`.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
```

##### Step 3

Now you're ready to provision an OpenShift cluster in AWS.

```bash
sudo ./op.py --env-file vars/aws.env --vars-file vars/aws.yml provision
```

If you are looking to use this project to create and setup the infrastructure
for an OpenShift install, but skip the install, you can run:

```bash
sudo ./op.py --env-file vars/aws.env --vars-file vars/aws.yml provision --skip-tags openshift_deploy_cluster
```

Once the provisioning has completed successfully, you will be able to access
your cluster at `{{ cluster_name }}.{{ openshift_base_domain }}`.

For example, if you set:

```yaml
cluster_name: ocp
openshift_base_domain: mydomain.com
```

your OpenShift cluster would be accessible at `ocp.mydomain.com`.

#### Manage

There is a helper script to make it easy to run this provisioner. It is the
`op.py` script.

You will see how to use `op.py` in the following subsections.

**Note:** For most actions of `op.py`, it will first try to pull the latest
version of the bundled provisioner. If you are on a slow connection (i.e. hotel wifi)
and want to skip this, pass the `--no-update` option.

##### Start / Stop

After your environment is provisioned, it's likely you'll want to shut it down
when you're not using it and be able to start it back up when you need it.

This is recommended as the compute costs for this cluster can get pricey if
left running. For example, the default cluster config would be:

- 1 t2.medium at $0.0464 per hour
- 2 m4.xlarge at $0.20 per hour
- 2 m4.large at $0.10 per hour

That comes out to a little more than $15 per day and ~$465 per month.

You can start and stop your cluster by:

```bash
# Start cluster
sudo ./op.py --env-file vars/aws.env --vars-file vars/aws.yml start
# Stop cluster
sudo ./op.py --env-file vars/aws.env --vars-file vars/aws.yml stop
```

##### SSH

If you need to SSH into the bastion/master, you can do that by:

```bash
sudo ./op.py --env-file vars/aws.env --vars-file vars/aws.yml ssh
```

##### Create / Update Users

If you need to add or update users in OpenShift:

```bash
sudo ./op.py --env-file vars/aws.env --vars-file vars/aws.yml create_users
```

##### Teardown

Once you no longer need your environment, you can tear it down by:

```bash
sudo ./op.py --env-file vars/aws.env --vars-file vars/aws.yml teardown
```

## Modifying The Playbooks

By default this tool uses the released versions of the repo playbooks. If you want to tweak anything locally and have the `op.py` script uses those changes you can. Be sure to pass `--dev` on the command line for those local changes to be used.
